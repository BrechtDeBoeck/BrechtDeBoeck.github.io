                    <li><h3>Web1 - Static website KSA Tervuren</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>This was my very first IT-project ever, and looking back now, it&#39;s also the worst. I had only just started my studies en we were given the assignment to make a static website regarding any subject, which was decided by the students in groups of four. My group decided on youth movements.</li>
                            <li>I spent more time on figuring out what I could show on the website than on the actual requirements of the project.</li>
                            <li>The css is very messy, but at least I managed to use it as an example of what not do. I&#39;ve since improved a lot, of course.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>OOO - Application sandwich shop</h3>
                        <section>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The project itself and the utilised design patterns were extremely interesting</li>
                                <li>The teamwork within my team was pretty much non-existent, and we were barely able to deliver the project on time as no one did their share of the workload except me.</li>
                                <li>It still amazes me how much work I was able to finish in one day for this project.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </section>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Huffman compression algorithm</h3>
                        <section>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Written in c++.</li>
                                <li>THE project to have really pushed my skills to their limits.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </section>
                    </li>
                    <li><h3>Minesweeper in WPF</h3>
                        <section>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Making the game was amazing. The style? Not so much...</li>
                                <li>Nothing too special: It&#39;s a basic Minesweeper-game with some preset difficulties, but you can also make your own custom difficulty by setting the various parameters to create the board yourself.</li>
                                <li>It also has two different themes (Light and Dark) and two separate screens: one for the game and one for the settings.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </section>
